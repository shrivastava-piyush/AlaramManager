\n\nLog Data
\n\nI want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

\n\nThis Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse the cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

\n\nService Providers
\n\nI may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

\n\nTo facilitate the Service; To provide the Service on my behalf; To perform Service-related services; or To assist me in analyzing how the Service is used. I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

\n\nSecurity
\n\nI value your trust in providing me with your Personal Information, thus I\'m striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.

In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from the servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
